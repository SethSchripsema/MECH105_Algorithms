## False Position Root-Finding Algorithm

This algorithm uses the fale-position method of root-finding to find the root. The function inputs are the function, the left and right guesses for the x values, the minimum error, and the maximum iterations.
The algorithm will output the root of the function, if there is one. As well as the y-value at the root, the error, and the number of iterations required.
