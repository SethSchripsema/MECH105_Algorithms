## Simpson's 1/3 Algorithm

This algorithm uses the Simpson's 1/3 Rule in order to calculate the integral of a function. The required inputs are two arrays, one of x values and one of y values. 
The number of terms in array x must equal the number of terms in array b.

The calculated integral will be displayed as the output.
