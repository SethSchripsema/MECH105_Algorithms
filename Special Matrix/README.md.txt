## Special Matrix Algorithm

This algorithm creates a special matrix where the first row and the first column are the index of the row and the interior entries are the sum of the top and left entries.
The input values are m and n, the number of rows and the number of columns in this matrix.

The output value will be a matrix that meets the requirements described above.
